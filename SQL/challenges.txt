/**
 * Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges.
 * Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student.
 * Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order.
 * If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id.
 * If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created,
 * then exclude those students from the result.
